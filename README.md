# pysesh

This repository contains some python training material used internally by Techmodal ltd.

There are two parts to this repository. The `introduction_to_python` folder contains the some jupyter notebooks
providing overview of python and some important packages like numpy and pandas. The `challanges` folder contains 
small python challanges to test out your skill.

The majority of the code is in jupyter notebook files (file ending in .ipynb). See [here](https://jupyter.org/install)
how to install jupyterlab. If you are using anaconda, it should be already installed. If you are using windows machine
I would recommend installing python via [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section).

There are a few files that are a python script (file ending in .py) rather than a jupyter notebook.
It's best to open these with Pycharm, but you can also do it with any text editor. To run these files, open conda command
prompt, `cd` into the folder where you store the python file (e.g. cd C:\Users\e.cemal\Documents\src\pysesh\hangman).
Run the file by typing `python hangman.py`. If you are using pycharm, and you set it up correctly, you can also
hit "run" button.

Other files are jupyter notebook files (file ending in .ipynb). To open these, open anaconda command prompt,
cd into the pysesh folder, and run `jupyter notebook`. This will open a webpage which will allow you to navigate
through the files and open the notebook you want.

PS: to connect anaconda to pycharm, at some point you need to enter the location of python interpreter.
