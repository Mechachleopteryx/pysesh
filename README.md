# pysesh

This repo contains some small python coding challanges. I have created a rough start, but we will solve the challanges together.

Some of the tasks is just a simple pyhton script (file ending in .py). Its best to open these with Pycharm, but you can also do it with any text editor. To run these files, open conda comman prompt, `cd` into the folder where you store the python file (e.g. cd C:\Users\e.cemal\Documents\src\pysesh\hangman). Run the file by typing `python hangman.py`. If you are using pycharm, and you set it up correctly, you can also hit "run" button.

Other files are jupyter notebook files (file ending in .ipynb). To open these, open anaconda command prompt, cd into the pysesh folder, and run `jupyter notebook`. This will open a webpage which will allow you to navigate through the files and open the notebook you want.
