# HANGMAN


With this project, you want to create a bit of code that will alow you play hand man. For this we will be using:

- pythons `input()` function which allows you to input text into the command line. This is how we will be guessing. 
- we wil use the `while` loop which will keep ittereating untill we do the right guess
- `if`, `if/else` blocks, `x in list`, we will use `==` to check if two things are the same.


The word that the function picks should be a random word from the techmodal mission statement (feel free to include your own words). What else does it need to do?


For this project, you can do it in one of two ways. Use an python IDE (integreated development enviroment, i.e. fancy text edditior) like PyCharm community eddition, or you can do it in jupyter notebook. If you are complete beginer to python, I would reccomend Jupyter notebok apporach.
