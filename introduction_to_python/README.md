# Introduction to Python

In this folder we find some jupyter notebooks that demonstrate
what you can do in python.
 
### Jupyter notebook?
Jupyter notebook files
allow you to keep text and code in one neat place.
This is particulary useful for writing analytical reports.
`ctrl + enter` will run a code block, and `shift + Enter` will run a code
block and go to the next one, `Alt + Enter` will run a code block and
create a new code block below.

### multi part introduction

These scripts are aimed to give you all you need to know in order to complete
some of the python challanges in this repository. They by no means constitute
a full and comprehensive python course, but it covers the most important bits,
and the rest you can discover on your own. I typically google my questions,
and someone would have answered it on stackoverflow.com years ago. If not, ask
a colleage, or post the question on stackoverflow.com and you will have an answer
within minutes.

I have added numbers to the different parts, but feel free to skip the parts that
are not of interest to you. Here is a brief description of what each notebook covers

- part 1, the basics: what are the data types, for loops, if statements, functions
- part 2, numpy: numpy is a great tool for working with data.
- part 3, pandas: and even better tool for working with data. (It is still useful to know about numpy, as pandas is built on top of it)
- part 4, databases: how to connect to a database, create tables, update entries
